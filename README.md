# AI-for-Astar-Game

Developed an AI player for the Astar game, implemented in Python with Pygame. The AI utilizes selectable Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms, allowing players to choose the level of strategic complexity. The project features a difficulty selection (easy, medium, hard) that determines the depth of the searches, while the scoring system is designed to be visible only to the AI during position calculations, enhancing its strategic decision-making.
